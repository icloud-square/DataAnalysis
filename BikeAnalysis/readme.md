# Bay-Wheels Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 1,863,721information of history trips made in 2018, including trip duration, start and end stations' names and locations, bike id and user types.



## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that 

1. Users prefer to take longer trip at weekends
2. Non-subscribers tend to take longer trip than subscribers.
3. Some stations which are popular during peak time tend to have more subscribers.
4. Users travel during peak time are more likely to be subscribers.
5. Trips number in each month is different but the duration distribution of weekly pattern and daily pattern are similar throughout those 12 months.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I divide the whole analysis into two parts: trip counts and duration distribution.

I first talk about the trip counts distribution under various categories such as different months in a year, different days in a week, different time period in a day, different stations and different user types. It turns out that the number of trips made is relevant to all of these factors. 

Then I talk about duration distribution under various categories such as over a week in each month,  over a day in each month and different user type in different time period. It turns out that the user type has significant impact on duration distribution.
